## Tech Stack and Responsive Design

- **React**: It enables the create reusable UI components such as the project card, making the site more modular and maintainable.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined classes. I cloud rapidly build custom user interfaces.

- **DaisyUI**:  A rich set of pre-designed UI components, seamless integration with Tailwind CSS. Allowing me to not reinvent the wheel but still able to costomize the wheel. Awesome !!!
