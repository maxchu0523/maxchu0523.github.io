## Tech Stack and Responsive Design

- **React**: It enables the create reusable UI components such as the project card, making the site more modular and maintainable.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined classes. I cloud rapidly build custom user interfaces.


The combination of React and Tailwind CSS allows for efficient development and ensures that the site adapts beautifully to various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
